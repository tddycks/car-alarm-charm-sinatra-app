CarAlarmCharm

Welcome to CarAlarmCharm. This app was created after a recent experience where a car alarm went off outside my apartment intermittently for over three days. I found out that there's very little that can be done about this unless the alarm happens to be going off when a police car drives by. I spoke to some neighbors but we had no idea how many people in our neighborhood had called the police, called 311 or done nothing. The car unfortunately was vandalized after a couple days probably from people's anger. This app will hopefully help people in situations like this. Users can report an alarm and talk amongst each other to figure out who has done what. Car owners can be emailed if their car alarms are going off. Together we can cut down the unnecessary noise pollution in New York City.
